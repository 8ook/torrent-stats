- given a torrent file:
	- create a HTML with magnet link (containing trackers?)
	- for each tracker show number of seeders/leechers at some time
	  (ipv4 and ipv6 separate and together if possible)
	- create RRD for graphs for few last torrent files

- can we use libtorrent instead of (some parts of) scraper.py ?
- we can change scraper.py to use libtorrent instead of separate bencode modules at least?
- check http scraper.py support
- fix/add IPv6 scraper.py support
